      content: "In the study of <a href=\"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/2/193.long\" target=\"_blank\">Brooks et al. 2011</a>, the Pasilla (PS) gene, *Drosophila* homologue of the Human splicing regulators Nova-1 and Nova-2 Proteins, was depleted in *Drosophila melanogaster* by RNAi. The authors wanted to identify exons that are regulated by Pasilla gene using RNA sequencing data.<br>
      Total RNA was isolated and used for preparing either single-end or paired-end RNA-seq libraries for treated (PS depleted) samples and untreated samples. These libraries were sequenced to obtain a collection of RNA sequencing reads for each sample. The effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events can then be analyzed by comparison of RNA sequencing data of the treated (PS depleted) and the untreated samples.<br>
      The genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled. It can be used as reference genome to ease this analysis.  In a reference based RNA-seq data analysis, the reads are aligned (or mapped) against a reference genome, *Drosophila melanogaster* here, to significantly improve the ability to reconstruct transcripts and then identify differences of expression between several conditions."

      As the genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* is known and assembled, we can use this information and map the sequences on this genome to identify the effects of Pasilla gene depletion on splicing events.<br>
      To make sense of the reads, their positions within *Drosophila melanogaster* genome must be determined. This process is known as aligning or 'mapping' the reads to the reference genome."

    - title: "<b>Step 4: Mapping</b>"
      intro: "Because in the case of a eukaryotic transcriptome, most reads originate from processed mRNAs lacking exons, they cannot be simply mapped back to the genome as we normally do for DNA data. Instead the reads must be separated into two categories:<br>
      <dir>
      <li>Reads that map entirely within exons</li>

      <a href=\"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml\">TopHat</a> was one of the first tools designed specifically to address this problem:<br>
      <dir>
      <li>1. Identification of potential exons using reads that do map to the genome</li>
      <li>2. Generation of possible splices between neighboring exons</li>

      <li>The library type</li>
      <li>The mean inner distance between the mate pairs for paired end data</li>
      </dir><br>
      These information should usually come with your FASTQ files, ask your sequencing facility! If not, try to find them on the site where you downloaded the data or in the corresponding publication.<br>
      Another option is to estimate these parameters with a *preliminary mapping* of a *downsampled* file and some analysis programs. Afterward, the actual mapping can be redone on the original files with the optimized parameters.<br>
      To help finding the needed previous information and afterward annotating RNA sequences, we can take advantage from already known reference gene annotations."

      To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (e.g. with or without PS depletion), an first essential step is to quantify the number of reads per gene. <a href=\"http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html\">HTSeq-count</a> is one of the most popular tools for gene expression quantification.<br>
      To quantify the number of reads mapped to a gene, an annotation of the genomic features is needed. We already uploaded the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/61771/files/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.78.gtf\">Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.78.gtf</a> with the Ensembl gene annotation for *Drosophila melanogasterto Galaxy."

      The recommended mode is 'union', which counts overlaps even if a read only shares parts of its sequence with a genomic feature and disregards reads that overlap more than one feature."

        <li> Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions</li>

      content: "
      <a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html\">DESeq2</a> is a great tool for DGE analysis. It takes read counts produced by **HTseq-count** and applies size factor normalization:
      <dir>
      <li> Computation for each gene of the geometric mean of read counts across all samples</li>
      <li> Division of every gene count by the geometric mean</li>
      <li> Use of the median of these ratios as sample's size factor for normalization</li>
      </dir>
      Multiple factors can then be incorporated in the analysis. In our example, we have samples with two varying factors:
        <dir>
        <li> Treatment (either treated or untreated)</li>
        <li> Sequencing type (paired-end or single-end)</li>
        </dir>  
        Here treatment is the primary factor which we are interested in.The sequencing type is further information that we know about the data that might effect the analysis. This particular multi-factor analysis allows us to assess the effect of the treatment taking also the sequencing type into account."

      As for DESeq2, we counted only reads that mapped to exons on chromosome 4 for only one sample in the previous step. To be able to identify differential exon usage induced by PS depletion, all datasets (3 treated and 4 untreated) must be analyzed with the similar procedure.<br>
      To save time, we did that for you. The results are available on <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61771\">Zenodo</a>, we will load them into your history using the file upload procedure as before. You can now create a new history."
